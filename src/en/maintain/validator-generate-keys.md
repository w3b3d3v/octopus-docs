## Generate Validator Account

Every validator must have:
* A NEAR account, used to log in to the Octopus network, register the validator, etc.;
* An appchain account, used to set the session key of the validator node, manage the appchain assets, etc.

To create a NEAR account, please refer to [Creating a NEAR Account](https://docs.near.org/concepts/basics/accounts/creating-accounts)

To create an appchain account, please use the following two browser plugin wallets:

* [Polkadot{.js} Wallet](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) is a simple browser extension tool that users can use to generate accounts, and use accounts to sign transactions.
* [Avatar Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/avatar-wallet/ckfhnogibicdkfkijinnacpmmobbhbjk) is a browser extension wallet designed for the Octopus network appchain ecosystem, supporting all native tokens of the Substrate appchain.
